/* Create a buffer of 100 samples (sliding window) that will calculate
 'Average', 'Average-forever', 'Upper Quarter Average' and 'Lower Quarter Average'. (Note: maximum size of buffer can vary)
- Every time a new sample enters the buffer the oldest sample will be overwritten in the buffer (if the buffer is full).
- 'Average' is the average of the 100 samples that are currently
in the buffer.
- 'Average-forever' is the average of all samples from the beginning of the run
- 'Upper Quarter Average' is the average of the newest 25 samples (if buffer size is currently 100).
- 'Lower Quarter Average' is the average of the oldest 25 samples (if buffer size is currently 100).
  For example, if samples buffer size is 8 and the last samples are 
[10,40,30,44,20,50,35,55]:
Then lower quarter average is the avg of 10,40 and the upper quarter avg is the avg of 35,55.
- Upon adding a new sample to the buffer, a check will be made to see whether the newly-calculated average is above a certain threshold, and if it is, a callback function will be called (in this example the threshold is 40 and the callback function is above_threshold_cb())
- Implement all AverageBuffer API functions mentioned in the following main() function - DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE. IMPLEMENT ALL OF YOUR FUNCTIONS IN average_buffer.h FILE.

--- MAKE SURE YOUR CODE COMPILES WITH NO ERRORS AND NO WARNINGS UNDER LINUX GCC. ---
